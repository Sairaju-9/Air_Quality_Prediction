# Air Quality Prediction

This repository contains a Python web application designed for predicting the Air Quality Index (AQI) based on a set of input parameters. The application utilizes a machine learning model trained on the [Air Quality Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Air+Quality) sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Installation

Ensure that you have Python 3.8 or a higher version installed on your local machine. Install the required packages by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Launch the application by executing the following command in the terminal:

```bash
python app.py
```

Afterward, open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000/. A web page will appear, featuring a form where you can input values for various parameters such as temperature, humidity, and pressure. Click the "Predict" button to obtain the predicted AQI value.

Alternatively, you can access the application online [here](^1^).
